<h1 align="center">Centipede Game</h1>

### Description
A simple `Centipede Game` coded in c++ language and using `Object Oriented Programming(OOP)` concept. It is using `GLUT / OpenGL` for graphics. The centipede keeps moving in the given area and you can fire bullets at it. You can shoot mushrooms to gain points. When the head of centipede is blinking (it does at random times), then you can fire at it and break it into two halves. There are a lot of other fun stuff as well that makes the game more interesting.
